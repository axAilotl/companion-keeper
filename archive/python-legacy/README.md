# Python Legacy Archive

This directory contains the pre-Electron Python implementation and related scripts.

Contents were moved here from repository root during the Electron migration cleanup.

Key items:
- `toolkit/` original Python UI and generation pipeline
- top-level `*.py` CLI wrappers and utilities
- Python environment files (`pyproject.toml`, `requirements.txt`, `uv.lock`)
- old Python app lifecycle scripts under `scripts/`

These files are archived for reference and are not part of the active desktop runtime.
